							<h2><b>Kaobnir</b> - Cristina Carbó Suquet</h2>
							<p><b></b>That's me! Wondering what that name means? It doesn't have any meaning in general. Just found it funny to get it as an Artistic name. Is actually an algorithm of my surname: Carbó, Aka Carboni to my circle of friends. Just put a K instead of C, and there you go! Hope you liked most of the stuffs that I'm showing at this Portfolio. Hope it helped to define myself as the Illustration and animation lover that I am. Thank You.</b></p>

									<h2>Kaobnir - Cristina Carbó Suquet</h2>
									<p>Hello! It's me again! Hope that everything you saw has been enough to let you to know me better. To make it clear, I love AE Animation and edition. I enjoy Audio editing and color correction. My passion is Illustration and I want to take it further to Animation itself. I do fine with 3D modeling and 3D animation. I'm pretty much adaptative to most of the stuffs that an Audiovisual Media Designer Student can offer! My email is: <b>kaobnir@gmail.com</b></p>
